# PortfolioProject 3
Case Study - Google Analytics Certificate Capstone Project

This is final course of Google Analytics Certificate program. 

I chose to research Case Study 2: How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?

You can learn more about the company and my analysis in my [powerpoint presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F6wSn9SVWGzNZCjJ7vrtH0TMXGdvUrjvypTh3MHaJII/edit?usp=sharing)


In github I shared my SQL queries for fitbit, which you can find [here](https://github.com/nuraberg1/PortfolioProject3/blob/main/fitbit_queries_script.sql). 

And I uploaded Python script that I used to clean files that had wrong format of timestamps, which you can find [here](https://github.com/nuraberg1/PortfolioProject3/blob/main/clean_file.py).
